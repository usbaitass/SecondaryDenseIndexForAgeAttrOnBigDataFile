# project for Advanced Database Technologies course

It was required to design secondary dense index on attribute AGE.
For a large file with billions of records, there can be many people of the same age scattered randomly in the data file. 
Even to store the SIN and AGE would result in big index file. 
So we decided to break data file in blocks and stored block indexes in a way to make it efficient.
You can view the design document in Team A Project Implementation.pdf file.
