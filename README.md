# project for Advanced Database Technologies course

It was required to design secondary dense index on attribute AGE.<br>
For a large file with billions of records, <br>
there can be many people of the same age scattered randomly in the data file. <br>
Even to store the SIN and AGE would result in big index file. <br>
So we decided to break data file in blocks and stored block indexes in a way to make it efficient. <br>
You can view the design document in Team A Project Implementation.pdf file. <br>
